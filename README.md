# Friday Night Funkin' - PolyEngine

**PolyEngine** is a custom FNF engine made for modding & playing. It includes downscroll.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.

# Features

 - **Downscroll and input**
	 - An improved input system, similar to osu!, with less delays, downscroll, and more!
 - **DFJK**
	 - Tired of being forced to use arrow keys and WASD? Well, you can now change to DFJK! (keybinding soon)
 - **Misses counter**
     - While you're playing, you can see your misses!
 - **Options menu**
	 - A full overhaul of the options menu where you can adjust several PolyEngine features!
 - **Pause menu overhaul**
     - An improved pause menu where you can see your current score, your deaths, and change difficulty.
 - **Note offset** (in beta)
	 - Change the offset of the notes. It's useful if you have a Bluetooth speaker / headphones.
